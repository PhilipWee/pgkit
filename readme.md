ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ NOTE ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

This repo has been renamed from `slonik-tools` to `pgkit`. The two packages included in `slonik-tools` - `@slonik/migrator` and `@slonik/typegen` - are replaced by `@pgkit/migrator` and `@pgkit/typegen`.

Both are almost entriely backwards-compatible with their `@slonik/` counterparts, but some reconfiguration may be required. They also now depend on `@pgkit/client` instead of slonik. See below for more details on each packages (as well as some new ones!)
