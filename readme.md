# pgkit

<blockquote>
ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ NOTE ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

This repo has been renamed from `slonik-tools` to `pgkit`. The two packages included in `slonik-tools` - `@slonik/migrator` and `@slonik/typegen` - are replaced by `@pgkit/migrator` and `@pgkit/typegen`.

Both are almost entriely backwards-compatible with their `@slonik/` counterparts, but some reconfiguration may be required. They also now depend on `@pgkit/client` instead of slonik. See below for more details on each packages (as well as some new ones!)

Right now, the default branch has been set to `pgkit`. You can still access slonik-tools on the `main` branch. Soon, the pgkit branch will be merged into main, the repo renamed, and the slonik-based libraries will live in a slonik-tools branch. Security updates will still be applied, and even feature requests will be considered if a need arises that isn't covered by pgkit.

Intended to include, some day:

- A SQL formatter - [sql-formatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sql-formatter) and [@sqltools/formatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sqltools/formatter) are good options, but produce pretty verbose statements. [prettier-plugin-sql-cst](https://github.com/nene/prettier-plugin-sql-cst) is fantastic, but requires prettier.
- A barrel package of all the above, for convenient installation
