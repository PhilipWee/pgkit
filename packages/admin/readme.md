## Introduction

### Features

- Schema-aware autocomplete:
  - tables, views, and functions from the database you're working with
  - columns from relevant tables/views/functions (e.g. with | as the cursor in `select | from mytable`, you will be suggested columns from `mytable`)
  - autocomplete fully-qualified names for tables not on the current session's `search_path`
  - suggest table-qualified columns for join statements (e.g. `select i| from profile p join settings s on s.profile_id = p.id` will suggest `s.id` and `p.id` rather than just `id`)
- results which can be copy-pasted directly into Excel or Google Sheets (using [reactgrid](https://reactgrid.com))
- [schemainspect](https://npmjs.com/package/@pgkit/schemainstpect) explorer of the full schema
- Simple but informative error reporting
- Queries stored in `localStorage` so your work is saved between sessions

### What about pgAdmin

Well, mostly because pgAdmin can be a pain to configure. It (usually) requires a custom docker setup, and requires lots of laborious clicking and form-filling to create a connection to a server. It also requires login by default, even for localhost-only dev setups. Once all that's done, it still takes a fair amount of drilling-down and right clicking to just start writing a query.

It also became cleare that, after porting [schemainspect](https://npmjs.com/package/@pgkit/schemainstpect), it would be possible to build a tool using fresh(er) UI components* which has more useful autocomplete.

It can also be more easily deployed as an internal admin tool against deployed databases, for existing stacks with a node.js backend (e.g. using express or similar). See the [library usage section](#use-as-a-library).

Finally, there are plenty more features that can be added to this. It's open source, and it's a simple react app. Take a look at the [future](#future) section and feel free to open a pull request, or create an issue, if you have an idea of something you'd like added.

*[codemirror](https://codemirror.net) and [reactgrid](https://reactgrid.com) do the heavy UI lifting.

## Get started

You can install and run either globally or locally.

Globally:

```bash
npm install --global @pgkit/admin
pgkit-admin
```

Locally:

```bash
npm install @pgkit/admin
npx pgkit-admin
```

You can then set the `connection-string` header in the UI. When developing against a local databse, this is all you'll need to do.

## Use as a library

```ts
import express from 'express'
import {getExpressRouter} from '@pgkit/admin'

const app = express()

app.use(getExpressRouter())

app.listen(5050)
```

For lower-level control, you can import a middleware for the API, and for the client static files, or there's a [trpc](https://trpc.io) router:

```ts
import {apiMiddleware, clientMiddleware, appRouter} from '@pgkit/admin'
```

## Auth

Auth isn't built in. @pgkit/admin was built primarily with a dev use case in mind, running against localhost. If you want to use it against a production database, you are responsible for authenticating database calls.

The simplest usage for local development is to send a `connection-string` header, which is fine for a local db, where the value might be something like `connection-string: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`. However headers sent to the backend are stored in localStorage on the client. So you likely wouldn't want to use this method for production. Instead, you can perform whatever auth checks necessary in a middleware in the backend, and use trpc to create your own middleware, which doesn't get the connection string from headers.

```ts
import {createExpressMiddleware} from '@trpc/server/adapters/express'
import {appRouter, clientMiddleware} from '@pgkit/admin'
import express from 'express'

const authMiddleware = getMyAuthMiddlewareSomehow() // e.g. https://authjs.dev/reference/express

const apiMiddleware = createExpressMiddleware({
  router: appRouter,
  createContext: ({req}) => {
    const connectionString = process.env.PG_CONNECTION_STRING
    if (!connectionString) {
        throw new Error(`Missing connection string in env`)
    }
    return {connectionString}
  },
})

const app = express()

app.use(clientMiddleware)
app.use(authMiddleware)
app.use(apiMiddleware)

app.listen(7003)
```

## ðŸ‘½ Future

- Migration management using [@pgkit/migrator](https://npmjs.com/package/@pgkit/migrator)
- SQL file browsing
- Table-based database editing. Add, edit, and remove rows from tables using a Google-sheets like UI
- [Maybe] a typescript script writer. Allow writing and runnning small scripts that use [@pgkit/client](https://npmjs.com/package/@pgkit/client) that allow doing some manipulation in JavaScript.
- Auto-formatting of SQL queries
- Prepared statement support, with variables supplied separately, similar to GraphiQL
